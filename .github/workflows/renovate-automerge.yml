# Ensure only one instance of this workflow runs per PR at a time.
# With cancel-in-progress: false, new runs wait for previous ones to complete
# instead of cancelling them. This prevents race conditions when multiple commits
# are pushed quickly (e.g., by Renovate rebasing), ensuring each commit's checks
# finish before the next automerge attempt starts.
# See example: https://github.com/camunda/camunda-deployment-references/pull/1352
